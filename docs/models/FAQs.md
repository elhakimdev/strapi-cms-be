### Product Table - Content Modelling Design

Certainly! Below is an example of how you might structure a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) content type in Strapi:

1. **FAQs Content Type:**

    - **FAQ:**
        - `faq_id` (Auto-incrementing ID, Primary Key)
        - `question` (String, required)
        - `answer` (Text, required)
        - `category` (String or Relation to Category content type, depending on your needs)
        - `order` (Integer, to control the display order)
        - `created_at` (Date, Auto-generated)
        - `updated_at` (Date, Auto-generated)

    - **Category:**
        - `category_id` (Auto-incrementing ID, Primary Key)
        - `category_name` (String, required)
        - `created_at` (Date, Auto-generated)
        - `updated_at` (Date, Auto-generated)

With this structure, each FAQ item has a unique ID, a question, an answer, an optional category, and an order to control its position in the list. The category is a separate content type to group FAQs based on common themes. The `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are automatically managed by Strapi.

Remember to adjust the structure based on your specific needs. You can add more fields or relationships depending on the complexity of your FAQ section. After defining these content types in Strapi, you can use the Strapi admin panel to create and manage FAQs and categories.
