This structure allows you to manage career opportunities, including details such as job position, department, location, job type, description, requirements, responsibilities, and application deadline. The `JobApplications` content type enables you to track applications, including the applicant's name, contact information, resume, cover letter, application date, and status.

Adjust the structure based on your specific requirements. If you have different types of job postings or additional information to track, you can modify the content types accordingly.

After defining these content types in Strapi, you can use the Strapi admin panel to create and manage career opportunities on your manufacturing company's website.
